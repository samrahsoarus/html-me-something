        <h1>LOST & FOUND</h1>
        <P>
            Everytime I'm lost I'm found<br>
            Universe keeps spinning round<br>
            Inner voice is shouting now<br>
            Heart leads me without a sound<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Guardians they show the way<br>
            Despite mistakes don't turn away<br>
            Their love its real it has no bounds<br>
            They cheer for the day I'm found<br>
        </p>
        <p> 
            Who am i anyway?<br>
            The question that I ask always<br>
            Get lost up in this silly maze<br>
            The weeks the months the nights the days<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Counting down to what today?<br>
            When I can grasp why I was made?<br>
            Its simple and its straight away<br>
            The looks the goods they fade away<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            What's left when my body's laid<br>
            And I review this escapade<br>
            We are here to love and play<br>
            The rest don't matter anyway<br>
        </p>
